# 2D-Platformer-Character

For some reason GitHub desktop lost the location of my repository in my desktop and wouldn't let me clone another because it already exists. I know doesn't make much sense. I have included a screenshot of the game through the editor and in-game play. I am not able to get the files to you so this is the best I can do. At the time of writing this I hope to also include a recording so hopefully that is in here too. Other changes I made is the player has 50 health instead of 100 as well as there are 3 enemies to stop you from collecting the coins. Once you collect all the coins you win and the window closes.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3

The player sprite is adaptated from [MV Platformer Male](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.
